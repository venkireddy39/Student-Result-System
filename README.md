# Student-Result-System
Student Result System is a Java console app that calculates and checks a student's result for 6 subjects. It validates the input, checks marks against a pass criterion (35), and provides the total, average, and overall result. If invalid marks (greater than 100 or negative) are entered, it prompts the user to re-enter valid marks.
